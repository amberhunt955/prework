      <h3>Video Example</h3>
      <p class="silverp">
        Now, back to my favorite job in New Zeland - calf rearing on a dairy
        farm<br /><br />

        I liked this job because it involved a lot of learning and a lot of
        problem solving. I didn't grow up on a farm so I had to learn how to
        handle animals, drive various farm vehicles, and more. Every day was
        different! I was always having to figure out what the most efficient way
        to go about my day would be.<br /><br />

        My partner made a video that includes some footage from the calf rearing
        season on our farm. You can watch it below.
