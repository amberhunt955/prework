	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	<p id="para1">For most of my adult life, I have been living nomadically as a backpacker. 
        I just moved home to Ohio in September 2022 from New Zealand, where I had been living on a temporary work visa since 
        December 2019. When I first arrived in the New Zealand, I had no idea that my one year visa would be extended 4 times 
        due to the impending global pandemic. Getting "stuck" in New Zealand gave me the opportunity to work and travel in the 
        country for nearly three years!</p>

	<h4>What surprised me about living in New Zealand?</h4>

	<p>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the birds! New Zealand has some pretty special native birds. 
        My favorite are Piwakawaka, Kea, and Weka, but there are so many more. I love that you can almost always hear the birds singing, 
        even when you are in the middle of Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand.</p>

	<h4>How was I able to live and work in New Zealand?</h4>

	<p>If you or someone you know is between the ages of 18 and 30, has a US passport, and proof of $4200 NZD 
        to help cover arrival costs, it is actually not too difficult to get the temporary visa I was on - a Working Holiday Visa. 
        You can find more information on the
