	<h4>Video Example</h4>

	<p class="silverp">Now, back to my favorite job in New Zeland - calf rearing on a dairy farm<br><br>
        
    I liked this job because it involved a lot of learning and a lot of problem solving. 
    I didn't grow up on a farm so I had to learn how to handle animals, drive various farm vehicles, and more. 
    Every day was different! I was always having to figure out what the most efficient way to go about my day would be.<br><br>

	My partner made a video that includes some footage from the calf rearing season on our farm. You can watch it below.</p>
