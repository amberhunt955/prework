      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p id="para1">
        For most of my adult life, I have been living nomadically as a
        backpacker. I just moved home to Ohio in September 2022 from New
        Zealand, where I had been living on a temporary work visa since December
        2019. When I first arrived in the New Zealand, I had no idea that my one
        year visa would be extended 4 times due to the impending global
        pandemic. Getting "stuck" in New Zealand gave me the opportunity to work
        and travel in the country for nearly three years!

      <h3>What surprised me about living in New Zealand?</h3>
      <p>
        I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the birds! New Zealand has some
        pretty special native birds. My favorite are Piwakawaka, Kea, and Weka,
        but there are so many more. I love that you can almost always hear the
        birds singing, even when you are in the middle of Auckland, the largest
        city in New Zealand.

        <h3>How was I able to live and work in New Zealand?</h3>
        <p>
          If you or someone you know is between the ages of 18 and 30, has a US
          passport, and proof of $4200 NZD to help cover arrival costs, it is
          actually not too difficult to get the temporary visa I was on - a
          Working Holiday Visa. You can find more information on the
